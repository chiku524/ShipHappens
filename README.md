# ShipHappens

**6–8 player cartoon space freight co-op** with social deduction. Friends complete absurd jobs on a discount orbital station while one or two **Stowaways** smuggle contraband and sabotage the run.

Built with **Godot 4** · Third-person · Full cartoon physics · Steam-bound indie

## Elevator pitch

You and your friends are the worst freight crew in the galaxy. Load weird **space goods**, survive slapstick physics, and catch the Stowaway before ShipHappens Logistics fires you all.
