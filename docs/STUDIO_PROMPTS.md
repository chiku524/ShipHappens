# Immersive Studio prompt pack — PudgyMon: Party Saga

Copy-paste prompts for [Immersive Labs Studio](https://github.com/chiku524/immersive.labs) / Tripo jobs.

**Important:** Studio does **not** cache prior prompts. Every job is independent. Each fenced block below is a **complete** prompt — paste it alone. Do not rely on a shared style block, a previous job, or a “prepend this” wrapper.

After generation → import → place (see [STUDIO_ASSETS.md](STUDIO_ASSETS.md)). Stand-in map: [ASSET_WISHLIST.md](ASSET_WISHLIST.md). Character + accessory contract: [CHARACTERS.md](CHARACTERS.md).

**Theme lock:** cute chunky **Pudgy Monsters** in a party playground — The Nest + Race / Vibe Collect / Shooter. Not freight, vaults, or corporate comedy.

**Export settings (all jobs)**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|--------|
| Format | GLB with baked Tripo PBR |
| Pivot | Floor center (characters / props) · wear origin (accessories) |
| Facing | Character faces −Z (Bevy forward) when possible |
| Units | 1 unit ≈ 1 meter |
| Naming | Folder + file = `asset_id` / `asset_id.glb` |
| Characters | After polish: baked ~1.2 m height, `uniform_scale` `1.0`. Raw Tripo imports: run `scripts/polish_character_glb.py` |

**Art direction (characters):** soft **stylized cartoon 3D** — think Pokémon (recent 3D games), Kirby, Animal Crossing villagers, Fall Guys softness. Flat-to-soft painted color, big graphic shapes, friendly readability. **Not** clay, polymer clay, ceramic, glossy vinyl, injection-molded plastic shine, or photoreal toys.

**Optional negative prompt (if Studio supports a separate field):**

```
photorealistic, grimdark, horror, blood, realistic weapons, space freight, corporate office,
tiny unreadable labels, multiple objects, diorama, landscape, adult human proportions,
clay, polymer clay, ceramic, earthen texture, stone, mud, fingerprint texture,
